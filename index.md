## ABOUT ME <a name="1"></a>

I have been studied in BSUIR for 3 years. During my studies I was learning OOP and programming. After that I decided to connect my future with .NET development. So I want to improve my skills and then to become a specialist in this sphere. 

I'm ready to deal with difficult tasks, to interact closely with team members and to be responsible for my work.

## INTERESTS <a name="2"></a>

- deep learning. At the university I have some difficult but interesting subjects such as OOP, System programming, Hardware design, Cirquit design. I spend a lot of time doing laboratory works which are useful and hard at the same time.

- travelling. I've already visited a lot of different European countries. Every year I go abroad during my vacation. That's great to visit beatiful places and meet foreignes. Especialy I enjoy going to the mountains and climbing them or skiing in winter.
